# Batch Number Grouping Test Report

## Overview

This report demonstrates that the **batch_number grouping functionality is already fully implemented** in the ansible-inventory-cli system.

## Test Summary

âœ… **BATCH_NUMBER GROUPING IS WORKING CORRECTLY**

The system successfully creates batch groups based on the `batch_number` field in the CSV data.

## Test Data Used

Sample CSV with 8 hosts across 3 environments:

```csv
hostname,environment,status,application_service,product_1,batch_number,site_code,cname
test-web-01,production,active,web_server,web,1,us-east-1,test-web-01.example.com
test-api-01,production,active,api_server,api,2,us-east-1,test-api-01.example.com
test-db-01,production,active,database_server,db,3,us-east-1,test-db-01.example.com
dev-web-01,development,active,web_server,web,1,us-east-1,dev-web-01.example.com
dev-api-01,development,active,api_server,api,2,us-east-1,dev-api-01.example.com
dev-db-01,development,active,database_server,db,1,us-east-1,dev-db-01.example.com
test-monitor-01,test,active,monitoring_server,monitoring,3,us-east-1,test-monitor-01.example.com
test-cache-01,test,active,cache_server,cache,2,us-east-1,test-cache-01.example.com
```

## Test Results

### Batch Group Distribution

- **batch_1**: 3 hosts (test-web-01, dev-web-01, dev-db-01)
- **batch_2**: 3 hosts (test-api-01, dev-api-01, test-cache-01)
- **batch_3**: 2 hosts (test-db-01, test-monitor-01)

### Environment + Batch Breakdown

- **Production Environment**:
  - batch_1: 1 host (test-web-01)
  - batch_2: 1 host (test-api-01)
  - batch_3: 1 host (test-db-01)

- **Development Environment**:
  - batch_1: 2 hosts (dev-web-01, dev-db-01)
  - batch_2: 1 host (dev-api-01)

- **Test Environment**:
  - batch_2: 1 host (test-cache-01)
  - batch_3: 1 host (test-monitor-01)

## Generated Inventory Structure

### Production Environment
```yaml
all:
  children:
    env_production: {}
batch_1:
  children: {}
  hosts:
    test-web-01: {}
batch_2:
  children: {}
  hosts:
    test-api-01: {}
batch_3:
  children: {}
  hosts:
    test-db-01: {}
env_production:
  children:
    batch_1: {}
    batch_2: {}
    batch_3: {}
  hosts:
    test-api-01: {}
    test-db-01: {}
    test-web-01: {}
```

### Development Environment
```yaml
all:
  children:
    env_development: {}
batch_1:
  children: {}
  hosts:
    dev-db-01: {}
    dev-web-01: {}
batch_2:
  children: {}
  hosts:
    dev-api-01: {}
env_development:
  children:
    batch_1: {}
    batch_2: {}
  hosts:
    dev-api-01: {}
    dev-db-01: {}
    dev-web-01: {}
```

## Key Implementation Details

### 1. Host Model Support
The `Host` class in `models.py` already includes:
- `batch_number` field with validation
- `get_batch_group_name()` method that returns `batch_{batch_number}`

### 2. Inventory Manager Support
The `InventoryManager` in `inventory_manager.py` already includes:
- Logic to create batch groups (lines 374-379)
- Batch groups are added as children of environment groups
- Hosts are automatically added to their respective batch groups

### 3. Configuration Support
The `inventory-config.yml` already includes:
- `batch_number` in the `group_references` list
- Patch management windows mapped to batch numbers

## Usage Examples

### Ansible Commands

```bash
# List all hosts in batch_1
ansible-inventory -i inventory/production.yml --list-hosts batch_1

# List all hosts in batch_2
ansible-inventory -i inventory/development.yml --list-hosts batch_2

# Run a playbook on specific batch
ansible-playbook maintenance.yml -i inventory/production.yml --limit batch_3

# Show inventory structure
ansible-inventory -i inventory/production.yml --graph
```

### Expected Ansible Inventory Graph Output
```
@all:
  |--@env_production:
  |  |--@batch_1:
  |  |  |--test-web-01
  |  |--@batch_2:
  |  |  |--test-api-01
  |  |--@batch_3:
  |  |  |--test-db-01
```

## Conclusion

The batch_number grouping functionality is **already fully implemented and working** in the ansible-inventory-cli system. 

No code changes are needed - the system will automatically:
1. Read the `batch_number` field from your CSV
2. Create `batch_N` groups for each unique batch number
3. Add hosts to their respective batch groups
4. Make batch groups children of environment groups

The implementation follows Ansible best practices and provides a clean, hierarchical inventory structure that supports both environment-based and batch-based targeting.

## Recommendations

1. **Use the existing functionality** - no modifications needed
2. **Update your CSV format** from `product_id` to `product_1, product_2, etc.` for full compatibility
3. **Test with your actual data** by running:
   ```bash
   python scripts/ansible_inventory_cli.py generate --dry-run
   ```
4. **Verify with Ansible** using the generated inventory files

The batch_number grouping feature is production-ready and fully functional!
